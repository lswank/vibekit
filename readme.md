## üìã Overview

VibeKit is an innovative Python library that breaks the traditional programming paradigm. Instead of being constrained by predefined methods, VibeKit interprets your function calls dynamically, allowing you to express your intent through natural function names and parameters. This creates a flexible, intuitive development experience where the library adapts to your needs.

VibeKit uses Large Language Models (OpenAI or Anthropic) behind the scenes to understand and execute your function calls. Simply provide your API key, and VibeKit will handle the rest.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dynamic Function Interpretation** - Call any function you can imagine, and VibeKit will interpret your intent
- **Asynchronous Support** - It basically only works with `async`/`await` so async by default!
- **Intuitive API** - Natural programming interface that adapts to your thinking process (or lack thereof)
- **LLM Integration** - It's really the whole thing that powers it
- **Zero Configuration** - Get started with minimal setup -- add an API key and go

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install vibekit

# Using poetry
poetry add vibekit
```

## üîß Quick Start

Initialize the client, connect to the service, and start using dynamic functions:

```python
from vibekit import VibeKitClient

# Initialize with your API key (OpenAI or Anthropic)
vibe = VibeKitClient(
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Required: OpenAI or Anthropic API key
)

# Connect to the service
await vibe.connect()

# Use any function name that expresses your intent
# Parameter names are optional - VibeKit can infer intent from values alone!
sum_result = await vibe.calculate_sum(5, 10)
# Or simply:
# sum_result = await vibe.calculate_sum(5, 10)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 15

# VibeKit interprets your intent from function names and parameters
weather = await vibe.get_weather_for(city="New York")
# Or simply:
# weather = await vibe.get_weather_for("New York")
print(weather)  # Output: Weather data for New York
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Mathematical Operations

```python
# Addition (with named parameters)
sum_result = await vibe.add(5, 3)
# or
sum_result = await vibe.calculate_sum(5, 3)

# Complex calculations (with named parameters)
result = await vibe.calculate_compound_interest(principal=1000, rate=0.05, years=5)

# Remember: Parameter names are optional and it's fun to let VibeKit guess!
# These would work just as well, with YMMV on results:
# result = await vibe.calculate_compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 5)
```

### Data Processing

```python
# Filter a list (with named parameters)
filtered_data = await vibe.filter_by_property(data=users, property="age", condition="> 30")

# Sort collection (with named parameters)
sorted_items = await vibe.sort_by_price(items=products, order="ascending")

# Parameter names help with clarity but are completely optional
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

```python
client = VibeKitClient(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    timeout=5.0,  # Request timeout in seconds
    retries=3,  # Number of retry attempts
    debug=True,  # Enable debug logging
)

# You can also update configuration after initialization
vibe.set_config({
    "timeout": 10.0,
    "retries": 5
})
```

## üìö API Documentation

### Core Methods

- `vibe.connect()` - Initializes the library and establishes connections to the LLM service
- `vibe.disconnect()` - Cleans up resources
- `vibe.set_config(options)` - Updates client configuration
- `vibe.get_status()` - Returns the current connection status and provider information

### Dynamic Functions

VibeKit's core philosophy allows you to call any function by name. The library gets your intent interpreted based on:

- The function name (e.g., `calculate_tax`, `fetch_user_data`)
- The parameters provided (e.g., `tiny_bipedal_deductions`, `number_of_mortgages`)

## üöÄ Advanced Examples

### The Ridiculous Frontier: Orbital Mechanics Calculator

Want to see how far VibeKit can go? Here's an example that demonstrates the absurd power of dynamic function generation - generating an entire web application for orbital mechanics calculations with just a few lines of code.

In this example, VibeKit handles both the complex math of Hohmann transfer orbits AND generates a complete styled web interface on the fly:

<img src="assets/images/hohmann_transfer_01.png" alt="Hohmann Transfer Diagram" width="500"/>

```python
# Generate a complete HTML page with Hohmann transfer calculation results
response = await vibe.generate_hohmann_transfer_results_page_html(
    style="Make it look like the Apple homepage",
    initial_orbit_radius=initial_orbit_radius,
    final_orbit_radius=final_orbit_radius,
    gravitational_parameter=gravitational_parameter,
    include_visualization=True,
    visualization_style="ASCII ART STYLE",
    back_link_url="/"
)

# Parameter names improve readability, but VibeKit would understand even without them!
```

This function doesn't actually exist in the codebase - VibeKit interprets this request dynamically, using AI to:
1. Understand what a Hohmann transfer is
2. Perform the complex orbital mechanics calculations
3. Generate a complete, styled HTML page with results
4. Create visualizations of the transfer orbit

No HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or orbital mechanics knowledge required!

### The Complete Flask Example

Here's how the entire Flask route is implemented:

```python
@app.route('/calculate', methods=['POST'])
def calculate():
    """Handle form submission and return results."""
    # Get form data
    initial_orbit_radius = float(request.form.get('initial_orbit_radius', 6778))
    final_orbit_radius = float(request.form.get('final_orbit_radius', 42164))
    gravitational_parameter = float(request.form.get('gravitational_parameter', 398600))
    
    # Let VibeKit handle both the calculation and result display
    async def get_results():
        response = await vibe.generate_hohmann_transfer_results_page_html(
            style="Make it look like the Apple homepage",
            initial_orbit_radius=initial_orbit_radius,
            final_orbit_radius=final_orbit_radius,
            gravitational_parameter=gravitational_parameter,
            include_visualization=True,
            visualization_style="ASCII ART STYLE",
            back_link_url="/"
        )
        return response["html"] if isinstance(response, dict) and "html" in response else response
    
    result = loop.run_until_complete(get_results())
    return result
```

## What the Hell?

Is this satire? Yes, kind of. It's obviously horribly inefficient and not how you'd build a production system. At the same time, if you're prototyping something quickly and want to outsource one part of the development process temporarily, it's not actually a horrible idea.
